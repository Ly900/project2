# Rubric
## Project Workflow
Meets/Exceeds expectations. It looks like you did really great planning for this application and it is very evident! Seems like you hit most of your user stories. I really love your readme that it has setup instructions for collaboration as well as icebox features you'd like to implement. I would try utilizing a gui of some kind for ERD's and wireframing.

## Technical Requirements
Meets expectations. I'm still not entirely sure what `load_and_authorize_resource` does. But the CRUD in your application is solid and is evident of full understanding of course materials to this point. I really love that you abstracted some of your "business" logic into your models for logs(ie. getting the different faces for logs) Would love to see some validations in your model as well.

## Code Quality
Code looks properly indented and well maintained. There's a bit of extra code in your `application.js`. Also, there's a severe lack of comments in your code base! Make sure you comment you code! It will help you out a lot going forward in your web dev career.

## Deployment and Functionality
Meets expectations. App is deployed to heroku and fully functional! Looks great to boot.

## Overall
Really wonderful job on this project Ly. Based on the results of this project it seems you have a solid foundation of all the things covered in Unit 2. Let me know if you have any questions/comments/concerns about rubric and/or feedback
